# Graph Exercises

## Exercise 1 - A class for representing undirected weighted graph nodes

You are given the class definition below, which represents a single node in an undirected weighted graph.
We will be using this class for the rest of exercises in this set. Read thoroughly and try to understand the class definition and associated constructor and instance methods.

In order to get you started, we provide several static methods of the form `generateExampleGraphN`, with `N` being a number from 1 to 8. Each of these static methods generates a different undirected weighted graph. You may want to add additional methods for your tests.

In a piece of paper, draw the graphs created by each of these static methods, included the weights (also known as costs) associated to the graph edges. 

Exercise 2 - Iterative DFS (Depth-First-Search)
Implement the following instance method of the GraphNode<T> class:
